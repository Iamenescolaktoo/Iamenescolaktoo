• Lead biweekly workshops (systems, architecture, intro cybersecurity).
• Align mentoring with chapter‑wide technical/pro dev goals.

## 💼 Experience (selected)

### 💾 Database Engineer Intern — Ankara, Türkiye *(Sep 2025 – May 2026)*
- Designed and maintained a **MySQL** schema to store thousands of Turkish news articles with metadata (`publisher`, `date`, `URL`) and **NLP outputs** (`sentiment`, `entities`, `classifications`).
- Normalized tables to reduce redundancy and boost query performance and data reliability.
- Planned deployment on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for fast filtering and retrieval of processed datasets.

### ⚙️ Technical Solutions Engineer Intern — Ankara, Türkiye *(Jun 2025 – Aug 2025)*
- Worked with a **3-person engineering team** to build an **automated data pipeline** for real-time analysis of Turkish news and political trends.
- Integrated **OpenAI APIs** to automatically evaluate `sentiment`, `toxicity`, and `significance` scores.
- Developed an **interactive dashboard** using `Flask`, `Streamlit`, and `Pandas` for real-time visualization.


**Research Assistant (GEARUP) — UIUC (Jun 2024 – May 2025)**
• Research + data interpretation for computing curricula; feedback loops and UX‑driven improvements.

## 📝 Research & Publications

* **GEAR UP Research Assignment → ACM Digital Library:** [doi:10.1145/3632620.3671123](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632620.3671123)
● Collaborated on a study of 20 conversational programmers (non-CS majors), designing surveys grounded in
Expectancy–Value Theory.
● Performed data analysis on non-major surveys, combining summaries with hypothesis testing to surface motivation,
self-efficacy, and goals.
● Co-authored findings published at ACM ICER '24, showing conversational programmers were the largest group among
non-majors, with paradoxical motivations driven more by interest in computing than its utility.
